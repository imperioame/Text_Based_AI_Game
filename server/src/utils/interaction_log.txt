The 100th Day of the Leap Day

"It was a Wednesday, the day after the April 29th Leap Day, and I was preparing to go to work. I was a few blocks away from the office when I noticed that someone had put a lighted candle in the office, illuminating the outside of the building. I could see a lot of traffic moving around outside. I decided to go there to see what it was all about. I walked into the office, where I found a few employees with candles. I stood there for a minute or two, just admiring the light. I noticed a few others also had candles, but I did not see any of the other offices. Then I walked down the hallway, and at the end was a wall covered with candles. The first floor was lit, but the second and third floors were completely dark. Then I heard a voice call out, "Hey! Can I borrow one of your candles?" I was standing there, with my back to the wall,

I was a young boy living in a small village in England. I had a very bad imagination, always thinking of the bad things that could happen. I would often play with my little brothers and sisters, playing with them as if we were children again. It was a good time when we all thought we were children again.

Our family was very poor. I was the oldest, followed by my younger brothers and sisters. I had a very kind and loving father, who would try his best to keep us all safe and happy. My mother had died when I was a baby, and we didn't have anyone to help look after us.

I had no idea that I was a space explorer, until my father found out. I was found on the floor of the closet, hiding from my father. I had already started to play with my little brothers and sisters, and they had made me a doll. My father was really angry at me, and he had hit me. I was very upset, and I wanted to go to my mother and tell her what had happened. I begged my father to let me go, so I could go and tell my mother. He wouldn't let

My first novel, Angel in the Whirlwind, was inspired by the game Ultima 6. (Ceased to exist post-finish.) I also came up with the "shaman factor" idea, which was then adapted and turned into the short story I'm submitting now. A sequence of events directly inspired by several cultures from different planets in Ultima 6. The result was a SciFi story which tied in with the setting.

I wrote my second novel, The Lights of a New Dawn, as a direct reaction to the world in which my first novel took place. Although it was written during the 90s, it takes place during the Civil War in the fictional United States of America. Much of the novel takes place in New Orleans in the 1800s.

Both novels were published by Blurb Books. The sequel to Angel in the Whirlwind was called Little Thing. It was intended as a debut novel, but sold extremely well. I'm currently seeking a film deal for my second book.

I'll start by saying that I am a huge fan (and sometimes critic) of Steampunk.  The genre has always fascinated us as readers because it combines elements of science fiction into a genre which is often considered "non-fiction."

In this world, technology is advanced past anything we can imagine or even understand yet it has created some of its own problems - especially when dealing with power dynamics.
As you look around me in my office at 8:30 AM on January first amidst all these strange machines that are just doing their thing while people go about there business as usual...this isn't exactly how i expected to spend New Years day...
I've been working hard lately trying create something big for us but nothing seems fast enough everyone keeps getting hurt!
My assistant comes over looking worried "Boss! The Enforcer Task Force got into another fight tonight they're injured!"
The news starts spreading quickly through out our city now- an enforcers task force gets involved again?

 I not sure what can i do. What happens next?
 I Search for clues. What happens next? Can anyone help solve who could be behind such attacks?


Assistant:
What else have YOU done since then?! You were busy planning your attack against those bastards from hell!" My men tell him he needs rest after his latest mission..."Well if someone doesn’t step up soon…”
“Don’ worry boss,” one says.”We’ll find them!” And off onto more patrol duty goes Jack.

* As part AI language model here ,i suggest following actions based purely upon information gathered thus far :  
1) continue searching thoroughly . Keep digging
 I Call for help. What happens next? Who might come forth assisting ?
2 ) reach-out via contacts already established (if any exist), perhaps asking within cybertech circles specifically regarding intel wanted by authorities .
 If none active/functional search online
