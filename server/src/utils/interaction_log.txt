The 100th Day of the Leap Day

"It was a Wednesday, the day after the April 29th Leap Day, and I was preparing to go to work. I was a few blocks away from the office when I noticed that someone had put a lighted candle in the office, illuminating the outside of the building. I could see a lot of traffic moving around outside. I decided to go there to see what it was all about. I walked into the office, where I found a few employees with candles. I stood there for a minute or two, just admiring the light. I noticed a few others also had candles, but I did not see any of the other offices. Then I walked down the hallway, and at the end was a wall covered with candles. The first floor was lit, but the second and third floors were completely dark. Then I heard a voice call out, "Hey! Can I borrow one of your candles?" I was standing there, with my back to the wall,

I was a young boy living in a small village in England. I had a very bad imagination, always thinking of the bad things that could happen. I would often play with my little brothers and sisters, playing with them as if we were children again. It was a good time when we all thought we were children again.

Our family was very poor. I was the oldest, followed by my younger brothers and sisters. I had a very kind and loving father, who would try his best to keep us all safe and happy. My mother had died when I was a baby, and we didn't have anyone to help look after us.

I had no idea that I was a space explorer, until my father found out. I was found on the floor of the closet, hiding from my father. I had already started to play with my little brothers and sisters, and they had made me a doll. My father was really angry at me, and he had hit me. I was very upset, and I wanted to go to my mother and tell her what had happened. I begged my father to let me go, so I could go and tell my mother. He wouldn't let

My first novel, Angel in the Whirlwind, was inspired by the game Ultima 6. (Ceased to exist post-finish.) I also came up with the "shaman factor" idea, which was then adapted and turned into the short story I'm submitting now. A sequence of events directly inspired by several cultures from different planets in Ultima 6. The result was a SciFi story which tied in with the setting.

I wrote my second novel, The Lights of a New Dawn, as a direct reaction to the world in which my first novel took place. Although it was written during the 90s, it takes place during the Civil War in the fictional United States of America. Much of the novel takes place in New Orleans in the 1800s.

Both novels were published by Blurb Books. The sequel to Angel in the Whirlwind was called Little Thing. It was intended as a debut novel, but sold extremely well. I'm currently seeking a film deal for my second book.
